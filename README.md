# ImageToAscii

A simple wpf app that converts an image to ascii art.

Simple to browse for a local file or paste a url in the text box, select a size from the dropdown (the number is used to divide the image size to make it smaller if need be) then convert.

The UI is bland and unappealing but it works so...hey y'now.
