# ImageToAscii

A simple wpf app that converts an image to ascii art.

:memo: There are two size options, which are multiples of 16 in an attempt of getting a 16:9 aspect ratio (I'm sure that the image files aren't meant for that but I wasn't sure how to calculate width so i went with that)

:memo: The ui is awful and doesn't resize it only works if you full screen even then the buttons might be small, I miss html and css xaml is hell
